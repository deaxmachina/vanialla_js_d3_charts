# Various D3 experiments 

- Collection of attempts to learn and create various interesting visuals using D3. 
- Starting from code I find e.g. on Observable, I first recreate and understand the code,
and then create basic variations or shapes that I have in mind. 
- Everything here is an experiment and/or for learning purposes, rather than complete visualisations of specific data.
