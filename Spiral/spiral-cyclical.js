/* 
///////////// Cyclical Spiral for representing seasonal patterns //////////////
Note that this works in a way where each year is one full circle, and so the time 
doesn't get distorted even if the representation is a spiral. This is because the 
radius, which is based on a value in the data, naturally increases over time. 
if the radius was mostly static, we would just see a many overlapping circles
