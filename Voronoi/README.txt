Experiments in Voronoi diagrams 

Code based on Tyler Wolf: https://observablehq.com/@thetylerwolf/day-22-delaunay-voronoi#data

- Using vornoi digram with the new d3-voronoi package to really easily make interactions with points smoother 
by positioning points in a voronoi grid and setting interaction events to happen on the cells of the grid rather 
than just on the element 
- Also using the voronoi grid itself as art to generate banners, etc.
